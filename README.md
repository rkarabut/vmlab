## Building the VM
1. Download and install [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/) and [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads)
2. Set VM_SYNCED_FOLDER environment variable to your preferred host directory
3. Run `./build.sh` or `build.bat` depending on your choice of the host OS

Once the machine is ready, it can be launched from the Virtualbox manager. The default user is `ri`, with password `ri`.
